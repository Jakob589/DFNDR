For deployment you are going to need:
-  USB with 2 partitions, one bootable other contains original disk image. (Trasncend jetFlash 64gb)
-  keyboard and mouse

1. insert USB into usb 3.0 port and turn un the computer. After the "beep" pres "DEL" key on the computer

IMPORTANT!!
2. in BIOS go to -> Advanced -> Miscellaneous Configuration And set the OS support to WIN8.X
  (if not changed system will not reboot) 

3. go to the last tab and select "UEFI:JetFlash.." 

4. boot from "ubuntu live"

5. open terminal and insert "fdisk -l" find location of primary 1TB disk (probably /dev/sda)

6. find mount location of usbdata partition (probably /media/ubuntu/usbdata)

7. copy image the disk (has to be empty!) 
"sudo dd if=/media/ubuntu/usbdata/2020-4-16-DEFENDER.img of=/dev/sda conv=fsync bs=1M status=progress"

%% After compying img to the disk, it will stil look like it has all empty space.
%% The reason for that is because it is GPT disk image and during copying i have cut of the partition table at the end of the disk

8. in terminal run "gdisk /dev/sda"

9. you will be prompted with in console program where you will have to input the following characters, start with:
  - "v" (it will display disk status with at least one error . If there are NO errors you did something wrong when copying img)
  - "x" (will put you in expert mode)
  - "e" (will try to fix partion tables)
  - "w" (input "Y" to confirm operation)
  BRAVO you restored GPT partition tables

10. Open gparted to check if partitions are there. There should be 500MB FAT,18GB ext4 partition and 950GB of free space.

11. Right click on 18GB partiion, select "edit partition" and extend it to full 950GB 

12. Reboot the computer and make sure it does not get stuck while doing so. If it does, re-do step 2.
