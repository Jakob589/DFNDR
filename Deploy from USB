For deployment you are going to need:
-  USB with 2 partitions, one bootable other contains original disk image. (Trasncend jetFlash 64gb)
-  keyboard and mouse
-  Display with HDMI or display port

1. insert USB into usb 3.0 port and turn un the computer. After the "beep" pres "DEL" key to go the the BIOS. 

IMPORTANT!!
2. in BIOS go to -> Advanced -> Miscellaneous Configuration And set the OS support to WIN8.X

%%if latter not changed system will not reboot

3. go to the last tab and select "UEFI:JetFlash.." 

4. boot from "ubuntu live"

5. open terminal and run "fdisk -l" to find location of primary 1TB disk (probably /dev/sda)

6. find mount location of "usbdata" partition (probably /media/ubuntu/usbdata)

7. copy image the disk (has to be empty!) 
"sudo dd if=/media/ubuntu/usbdata/2020-4-16-DEFENDER.img of=/dev/sda conv=fsync bs=1M status=progress"

%% After copying img to the disk, it will look like it is empty.
%% The reason for that is because it is GPT disk image and during copying i have cut of the partition table at the end of the disk.

8. in terminal run "gdisk /dev/sda"

9. you will be prompted with in console program where you will have to input the following characters, start with:
  - "v" (it will display disk status with at least one error. If NO errors you did something wrong when copying img - IRONIC)
  - "x" (will put you in expert mode)
  - "e" (will try to fix partion tables)
  - "w" (input "Y" to confirm operation)

%%BRAVO you restored GPT partition table

10. Open gparted to check if partitions are there. There should be 500MB FAT,18GB ext4 partition and 950GB of free space.

11. Right click on 18GB partiion, select "edit partition" and extend it to full 950GB 

12. Reboot the computer and make sure it does not get stuck while doing so. If it does, re-do step 2.

13. To check if instalation was successful, leave computer for few minutes in order to connect to the mobile network,
then check if it logged in to videk sensor managnet system. Write down machine-id and link it with meaningful location

14. Check connectivity!! in order for the system and services (rundeck, videk,ssh) to work properly it needs good connection 
(At least 3 bars or ping the machine - RTT around 100ms is good enough)
